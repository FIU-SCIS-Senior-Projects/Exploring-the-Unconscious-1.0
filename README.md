This project is the first implementation of the compatibility algorithm developed by Mark Mohr. Exploring the Unconscious seeks to better connect your conscious wants with your Unconscious desires. The current application state consists of the following: A java engine, React-nativejs Front-end, and a Firebase back-end to hold data.


# Directory Structure
1. The code directory contatins Exploring the Unconscious app, Exploring the Unconscious Algorithm, and a directory for a java gui.
2. In the app directory there is an index.ios.js and an index.android.js file that runs the application natively.
3. There is a Views folder-holding all renderable views
4. Assets holds the images used in the application
5. Styles.js holds all stying for the views
6. Firebase.js holds the firebase configuration


# Running the application
1. Clone repository
2. Install node from nodejs.org
3. Install either a netbeans or a java compiler on your computer if not installed already.
4. Install react-native onto the computer.
5. Now in the directory for the react project run the command: "react-native run-ios"
